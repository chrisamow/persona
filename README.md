Persona is a simple demo of CRUD functionality using:  
	vue2 js and axios on the frontend  
	and using a RESTful API to connect to  
	python3.5 flask / sqlalchemy / any db on the back end  


#environment
	anaconda for python3
	after that is installed create the virtual environment

		conda env create --name per -f environment.yml

	pyflakes and pytest used throughout

	./models.py createdb
	./models.py sampledata gendata/clean500.csv




It is designed to eventually use lazy-loading/pagination as the next step for large datasets.
